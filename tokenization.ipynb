      "Three Steaks and a Box of Chocolates\n",
      "The day Burt McCall backfired into Dead End I got my last and most peculiar patient. I’d been standing on the termite-riddled planks of the sidewalk watching dust devils and my sign swinging in the wind. The two customers in the Dry Gulch Saloon hadn’t moved in their chairs all day. For all anyone knew, they could’ve been dead. Then Burt parked in front of the post office and that got my attention. If he had anyone to write to, no one knew about it. He came out a minute later with a small package. He tossed it into his tow truck and headed across the street to my establishment. “Why don’t you take that rusty can of yours out of town before you hurt someone?” I said, itching to know what was in the package. “I ain’t happy to see you, either,” he replied. “But I got something that needs doctorin’.” I looked him over. From his worn boots to his weathered face, he was none too pretty to look at. But a wealth of silver tumbled from beneath his old hat, and his eyes hadn’t lost their youthful spark. “You never paid for last time,” I said. “I’d think you’d want the business.” He stared meaningfully at my sign: DOC TURNER HEALING ARTIST Its groaning in the wind seemed to emphasize his point. Fact was, no one had passed beneath it for quite a spell. I admit I’d tightened my belt a notch or three. “This better be good,” I said. Inside my office, he reached into his pocket, pulled out a lump of gold, and slammed it on my desk. “That oughtta cover what I owe. Consider the rest a down payment. You’ll get a whole lot more if you help me.” “Is it real?” “Test it yourself.” I didn’t need to. I’d seen enough nuggets to know the real McCoy from the metal of fools—though, as for fools, Burt might take the cake. He seemed to make a profession of chasing crackpot dreams. “You didn’t pull this from that sand patch of yours. Who’d you steal it from? That way, I’m prepared when they come after me for it.” “Now that plain hurts, Doc. I’ve been tellin’ you all along there’s gold there, and there’s the proof. Just like I told you there’s water.” “The day you find water I eat my boots.” “Then you better put a fire under the pot so you can cook ’em when you get back. You gonna help me or not?” I rose, put on my hat, and grabbed my medicine bag. Business had dried up since the new doctor set up down in Black Rock. He was young and knew how to charm the ladies. I’m past my prime on that score and maybe behind the times in doctoring. I figured Burt’s gold would cover me for six months. Mainly, I wanted something to do besides watching dust devils. If anything else was happening in Dead End, nobody told me about it. “Well, what do you need me for?” I asked. “Fluffy ain’t feelin’ good.” “You want me to drive all the way over to your dump in this heat for a cat? Anyway, you don’t like cats.” He gave me a sly smile. “I don’t. Fluffy’s special.” I let that slide. “What’s wrong with her?” “I think she’s got a toothache.” He was looking at a photo on my wall, me standing beside a sleeping elephant, a red-and-white big top in the background. “You sure you didn’t kill that elephant?” “Couldn’t. He was the circus’s prize possession. But he went berserk when they sold his lady friend. Elephants are loyal that way. I used something that would drop a dinosaur and they paid me well for it.” I was feeling a little sad thinking about it. It was probably the last good bit of coin I’d seen. If things didn’t turn around soon, I’d have to close shop. The thought of moving at my age didn’t appeal to my bones, which were about as shaky as Burt’s truck. “You still got that tranquilizer?” “Probably somewhere.” “Get it. Fluffy doesn’t like pain.” I squinted at him like he was a crazy man, which he probably was. That didn’t matter. He wouldn’t drive clear to Dead End unless he needed to. Something was afoot, and I aimed to find out what. I threw some hypos and elephant tranquilizer into my bag. We piled into his truck and started bouncing down the road, sending up clouds of dirt. I hung on for fear of falling out. “If you’d brush that cat’s teeth, it wouldn’t have a toothache.” “I never heard of such a thing.” He grinned with those yellow teeth of his. “Tackling your own once a week might not be a bad idea either.” He came to a sudden stop in front of Newsom’s Hardware. “Fine.” He hopped out and a minute later returned with a push broom and a crowbar. “What’s that for?” “An ounce of prevention.” How many times the engine exploded no one would want to find out, but an hour later his mountain came into view. As the story goes, a bespectacled gent named Norman Fable from one of those big universities back east inspected it for a mining company. He declared it a likely place to find gold or silver. Everyone and their uncle descended on the place. For two decades they punched holes all over it and found zip. Now most people call it Fable Mountain. It seems a respectable way to immortalize the man. The Indians round here call it Awanyu, after their serpent god. They got it right. From this side, it looked like a snake stretched out on the floor of the desert, the east peak its head, the west peak an eroded cliff that curved up like a tail. Miles passed with nothing but cactuses, the sweat on the back of your neck, and horse flies the size of buffaloes. Burt was by himself out here. A lonely feeling settled into my bones. His lean-to came into view, stuck against the base of the mountain. There wasn’t a well in sight. “How do you survive out here without water?” He gave me that sidelong look again. “I got water.” “You old fibber. The only water is floating around your brain.” “Well, you can add your hat to your boots. Looks like you’re losin’ weight, anyway.” “I mean it, Burt. How do you get by?” Fact was, I cared about him. He pointed to a clay disk with painted triangles and spirals hanging from his rearview mirror. “Amulets.” “You can’t get by on luck.” “It ain’t luck. It’s magic. That’s what Indian Bob says. He ought to know.” “If that’s from Indian Bob you got swindled. He’s no more Indian than you are.” “Not so, I’m two-thirds Hopi and two-thirds Chippewa.” “Where do the McCalls fit in?” “The lost tribe. You can’t count ’em.” I didn’t want to argue. He was rather sensitive on the subject, and told all kinds of tales about giant bears, birds, and skunks, and rolling heads that gobbled up bad people. He swore he’d seen them hereabouts, but then again, he’d claimed he’d seen a sea serpent in his navy days. Said it would bring him luck one day. He pulled up to the lean-to and took up his package and the broom and crowbar he’d bought at Newsom’s. I followed him inside, hoping it would be cooler. The concept of shade didn’t seem to apply there, and sweat was rolling down my face. He offered me a pull from a canteen. I expected the water to be dusty. It was surprisingly cold and sweet. He watched me drink. “Don’t be bashful. There’s plenty where that came from.” I didn’t need a second invitation and poured half of it down my shirt. When the last drop trickled down my throat, I looked at him guiltily. “Sorry, I should’ve left you some.” He shrugged. “Take it, we’ll refill it.” I looked around, trying to figure this out. No well outside. Not even a water tank. An old wood-burning stove sat in one corner, a narrow cot in the other. An iron skillet, a Dutch oven, and a big spoon hung from the ceiling. A buffalo hide was nailed to one wall, probably to cover gaps in the planks that bands of light streamed through. More amulets were scattered about, long feathers, beads, bits of carved turquoise, dreamcatchers. If he was finding his dreams, I couldn’t see it. The front of the room was as clean as any bachelor’s, but toward the rear, a layer of dirt covered the floor. A curtain hung over the back wall. It stirred, though no wind came through the open windows. He lit a lantern and gave it to me. Smiling to himself, he put the package in a knapsack, slung it over his shoulder, and took up the broom and crowbar. With my medicine bag in one hand and the lantern in the other, I followed him to the curtain, wondering what all this was leading to. He parted the curtain. More dirt was piled to the left and right but dead ahead the wall had been torn away, revealing an opening large enough to step through. Inside, the temperature dropped. At first, I thought this was a mineshaft from the Fable days, but the walls were rocky and irregular, suggesting it was a cave. I turned to look back at the dirt piled near the opening. It looked fresh. “How’d you know to dig here?” I asked. “I did a sweat with Indian Bob and had a vision. It showed me the spot.” The passage angled down. Cool air wafted from below. As pleasant as it was to get out of the heat, that forlorn feeling settled on me hard. “Why do you live like this, Burt?” His eyes were flames in the glow of the lantern. “Like what?” “Alone. This place makes Dead End seem crowded.” “I’m not alone. I got Fluffy.” That didn’t reassure me. Neither of us spoke for a spell. He probably figured I’d run the other way if he said more. All I could do was see how this played out. Finally he said, “If you found somethin’ valuable, would you share it?” I considered. If I wanted to be a Rockefeller, I’d have taken a different road. “Sure would. Guess I don’t need much.” “That’s what I figured. And we’re friends, right? I can trust you?” “I’d have to be to go along with whatever you’re brewing here.” “Figured that too. That’s why I came to you and not that fake in Black Rock.” He wiped his eyes, which had grown misty. “Friendship’s a rare thing, Doc.” After a pause, he added, “Love, too.” A few steps farther the passage opened into a cavern so vast, the lantern couldn’t penetrate the limits of it. What got my heart pounding was the low, rhythmic lapping of waves. “Well, I’ll be,” I said. “You found water.” And not just a trickle. This was a sea, broad, wide, and gleaming dimly. Not far away, a deep moan echoed off the walls. I could conjure a lot of things in my mind and nothing to fit that sound. My heart froze. I swallowed, trying to moisten my throat, which was drier than the Mojave. “Is that what you brought me here for?” Burt set down the broom and crowbar and walked to the shore. “Yep.” “What is it?” “You can decide for yourself.” I looked behind me, wondering how long it would take to get back to sunshine, where scorpions and hungry coyotes seemed suddenly friendly. “Maybe I don’t want any part of it.” He turned back to me, hands on his hips. “You took a hippocritic oath.” “I’m beginning to feel like I did. Did I ever tell you I dropped out of medical school? Why do you think I opened shop in Dead End?” He came up and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder. “That don’t matter,” he replied. “You can cure the warts off a hog. I’m livin’ proof.” Small splashes drew near. Something was coming, cutting smoothly in and out of the water. “Look, Doc, you don’t have anythin’ to worry about. I told you, she’s a pussycat.” A groan like a sick cow reverberated through the chamber. “Is that her meow?” Burt wrung his hands. “She’s in pain. I don’t know what to do for her.” I waited, holding my breath, listening with dread and fascination as the splashes came on. Then I saw her, emerging from the darkness, first her eyes, shining like coins for a titan, then her brontosaurus head, which seemed to float above the water. A monstrous neck followed. Trailing thirty feet behind, her body looped through the water like a giant hose. The water must have been deep almost up to the shore. She left her body submerged and dropped her head on a flat rock as a dog that was feeling pathetic and under the weather might. Burt patted her head and scratched where her ears would be if she were a cat. “This here’s the doctor I told you ’bout.” She moaned again, but not so loud. Her eyes rolled until they locked on me. They were intelligent and hopeful. Since she hadn’t snatched Burt in those jaws of hers and dragged him underwater, I approached. “Why do you think it’s her tooth?” I asked. “She isn’t eatin’ normal.” “How do you know?” “She won’t touch anythin’ I give her.” “What do you give her, a cow?” He nodded to the water. “She catches lots of fish there. Three times a week I give her steak and some of these.” He pulled the post-office package from his knapsack and unwrapped it. Inside was a box of Dormel’s chocolates. “You give her that?” He gave me a bashful look. “She loves ’em.” I shook my head, pretty certain what the problem was. “Well, I better have a look. Will she open up and not snap my head off?” He stroked her nose. “Let Doc have a look and I’ll give you some of the toffee ones.” I swear she almost smiled at that and her head went up and down in what might have been a nod. She opened wide and displayed a set of nine-inch teeth the like of which haven’t been seen since this planet’s infancy. I handed Burt the lantern. “If I die, I’ll kill you.” He held it close while I bent in for a look. Those daggers were pearly white near the top, but a brown deposit had formed on the bottom. One back tooth looked pretty bad. The gum around it was swollen too. I rose and tapped the chocolate box. “That’s your problem. It’ll rot her teeth in no time.” “Can you do somethin’ for her?” “A tooth has to come out.” I rubbed my chin, studying her, trying to figure how to do it. She looked at me, her eyes innocent and trusting. If I hurt her she’d flail and make hamburger out of me with a whip from her tail, though she didn’t mean a lick of harm. “Thought so. Well, you brought the tranquilizer.” “That’s not it, Burt. I can’t exactly dig it out.” “You gotta help me, Doc. I’m lost without her.” He wasn’t the only one. It dawned on me I’d been lost a long time. Maybe she was the way out. A strange urgency gripped me. I had to do this or I was a goner; I’d blow away like dust. I looked around and then back the way we came. “How far is it to your cabin?” “Maybe a hundred fifty feet.” “How much cable you got on your tow?” His face lit up. “Two hundred.” “Let’s prep her. I want her down deep when we do this.” Burt coaxed her mouth back open. “This is goin’ to hurt a little. You just hold on. Doc’s goin’ to fix you up.” It might seem questionable to a sane person why I would put my faith in such reassurances, but I’d seen enough of her to risk it. I keep a supply of anesthetic in my bag and started with that, giving her a dozen shots around the tooth. For good measure, I added a few injections of penicillin. Next, I loaded four hypos with elephant tranquilizer. I didn’t bring a gun and wouldn’t have used it if I had. The sound would have scared her. I felt the scales on her throat and found a vein pulsing like a drum. Holding my breath, I stuck one in. She didn’t flinch. Probably wasn’t much more than a fleabite to her. “Let’s head up,” I said, closing my bag. “Tell her to stay put. If she goes unconscious and slips into the water, she could drown.” “No sayin’ what she’ll do on drugs.” He handed me the keys to his truck. “You get the cable. I’ll keep an eye on her.” He had a point about the drugs. I thought I’d better stay in case she had a reaction. What I would do for a creature like her was up for question. They didn’t cover that in medical school. I glanced at my watch. “Tell you what, let’s see how she does.” We waited fifteen minutes. Those giant eyes never closed. They did sink to half-mast. That great head of hers lolled on the rock. “Let’s go,” I said. “We got about forty minutes to do this.” He squatted before her. “Don’t go nowhere and I’ll give you more of these.” He held up the chocolates. The dreamy expression on her face got dreamier. We debated what she was on the way to his truck. Burt thought she was like that creature spotted in ’33 in northern Scotland. Wherever she came from, I was pretty certain she was Awanyu. Stories come from somewhere. If you came right down to it, the Hopis got things right. Maybe Indian Bob had some of their blood after all. To tell the truth, I was preoccupied with something else. How in the devil was I going to grab on to that tooth? I kept picturing it from all kinds of angles. The tooth broke in each scenario, leaving the root. By the time we were topside, I thought of something. “Have you got a hand drill with a big bit?” He found one in the back. The bit was just under an inch. It would have to do. Burt backed his truck as close to the front door as he could. Using the hydraulic, he fed out both lines, which had swivel hooks attached to chains. He took one. I took the other. On the way back down, I studied the passage walls. I saw no evidence of prospecting. Where had he gotten that nugget? When I asked, he gave me that sly smile. “Get that tooth out and you’ll see.” Below, the creature still lolled at the water’s edge. Her eyes hadn’t closed, but the dreamy expression hadn’t worn off, which gave me small comfort. I didn’t know how she would react to what I had in mind or if it would even work. Burt got her mouth open again. The tooth was conical. Using the drill at the base, I worked away at it, first on one side, then the other, enlarging both holes a little at a time. In my wildest dreams, I never thought I’d have my head so close to a monster’s epiglottis. She was a good girl though and didn’t stir once. Pretty soon the holes were large enough to work the hooks in. Now came the tricky part. One of us had to go topside and retract the cable. She needed Burt to keep her calm, but she might need me for another shot. We flipped for it. He went. I stayed. “Stay put,” he told her before leaving. “No matter what happens, stay put.” I watched the cable. We’d left some slack, so I’d have some warning. I checked my watch every few minutes. The tranquilizer could wear off anytime. Bless his heart, it didn’t take as long as I’d thought. I’m certain he ran all the way—he cared that much about her. The cable pulled taut. Her eyes flared. With a cry she yanked her head back and out popped the tooth, as neat as a cork. I’m here to tell you it’s hard to gauge a monster’s expression, but this one seemed relieved. I thought she might sink back to the rock. Instead, she reared back and dove, her long body flowing into the water. Burt ran up, panting. “Sorry,” I said. “She’s gone.” “She dove?” I nodded. He picked up the tooth and turned it in both hands. “She ain’t gone. She’s gettin’ your reward.” Sure enough, she resurfaced and swam toward us with something gleaming in her mouth. When she reached the shore, she deposited a nugget the size of Kansas. Nearly a foot long, to be more precise. Since then, I’ve debated with myself about what she was and whether others like her roam the rivers and byways underground. Sometimes I question if the whole thing happened, but the gold fetched a pretty penny, and I’m set up well now. I sold my practice in Dead End to a traveling snake oil salesman and moved to San Francisco, where the fog and ladies are more to my liking. Whatever happens from here on out, I won’t end up beside those two hombres in the Dry Gulch Saloon. Burt probably has more gold tucked away than me, but he stayed at the knees of Awanyu. I thought with all that water down there he’d license the rights or put in a golf course or something. He steadfastly refuses. To the world, he’s a hermit. I know better. He found his life companion, and that’s all there is to it. Every now and then I get a letter from him. He tells me he brushes Fluffy’s teeth regularly with the push broom and scores around her gumline with the crowbar. He doesn’t live extravagantly, but pays for weekly deliveries. I have it on high authority they consist of three steaks and a box of chocolates.\n",
